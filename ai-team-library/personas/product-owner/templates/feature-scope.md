## Problem Statement

[What user or business need does this feature address? Be specific about the pain point, not the solution.]

- [Rationale: why this is should-have, not must-have]

### In Scope (Could Have)

- [Capability that is desirable if capacity allows]
- [Rationale: why this is nice-to-have]

### Out of Scope (Will Not Have)

- [Capability explicitly excluded from this iteration]
- [Rationale: why it is excluded and when it might be reconsidered]
