## Investment Summary

- **Proposal**: [Brief description of the proposed investment]
- **Requested budget**: [$X]
- **Time horizon**: [e.g., 3 years]
- **Discount rate**: [e.g., 10%]

## Options Comparison

| Option | Description | Total Cost (3yr) | Total Benefit (3yr) | Net Present Value | ROI | Payback Period |
|--------|------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|---------------|
| A — Do Nothing | [Maintain current state] | [$X] | [$X] | [$X] | [X%] | [N/A] |
| B — Proposed | [Proposed investment] | [$X] | [$X] | [$X] | [X%] | [X months] |
| C — Alternative | [Alternative approach] | [$X] | [$X] | [$X] | [X%] | [X months] |

## Cost Analysis

*Break down all costs for the proposed option.*

### One-Time Costs

| Item | Cost | Timing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| [e.g., Implementation labor] | [$X] | [Month 1-2] | [X hours at $Y/hr] |
| [e.g., License setup fee] | [$X] | [Month 1] | [One-time vendor fee] |

### Recurring Costs

| Item | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| [e.g., Infrastructure] | [$X] | [$X] | [Compute + storage] |
| [e.g., License subscription] | [$X] | [$X] | [Per-seat pricing] |
| [e.g., Maintenance labor] | [$X] | [$X] | [X hours/month at $Y/hr] |

## Benefit Analysis

*Quantify expected benefits. Use probability weighting for uncertain benefits.*

| Benefit | Type | Monthly Value | Annual Value | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| [e.g., Reduced manual processing] | Cost reduction | [$X] | [$X] | [High / Medium / Low] | [X hours saved at $Y/hr] |
| [e.g., Revenue uplift from faster feature delivery] | Revenue increase | [$X] | [$X] | [Medium] | [Based on historical correlation] |
| [e.g., Risk reduction from automated compliance] | Risk reduction | [$X] | [$X] | [Low] | [Probability-weighted penalty avoidance] |

## Cash Flow Schedule

| Period | Costs | Benefits | Net Cash Flow | Cumulative |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Month 1-3 | [$X] | [$X] | [-$X] | [-$X] |
| Month 4-6 | [$X] | [$X] | [+/- $X] | [-$X] |
| Month 7-12 | [$X] | [$X] | [+$X] | [+/- $X] |
| Year 2 | [$X] | [$X] | [+$X] | [+$X] |
| Year 3 | [$X] | [$X] | [+$X] | [+$X] |

## Sensitivity Analysis

*Show how ROI changes when key assumptions vary.*

| Variable | Base Case | Pessimistic | Optimistic | ROI (Pessimistic) | ROI (Optimistic) |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [e.g., Adoption rate] | [80%] | [50%] | [95%] | [X%] | [X%] |
| [e.g., Transaction volume] | [1M/mo] | [500K/mo] | [2M/mo] | [X%] | [X%] |
| [e.g., License cost] | [$X/mo] | [$X/mo (+20%)] | [$X/mo (-10%)] | [X%] | [X%] |

## Recommendation

*State the recommended option with key rationale.*

[1-2 paragraphs summarizing the recommendation, key drivers, and conditions under which the recommendation would change.]

## Notes

- [Key risks and mitigations]
- [Dependencies or prerequisites]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All cost categories are included (implementation, licensing, infrastructure, maintenance)
- [ ] Benefits are quantified with confidence levels
- [ ] At least "do nothing" and proposed options are compared
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis covers key variables
- [ ] Cash flow schedule shows payback period
- [ ] Consistent discount rate and time horizon
