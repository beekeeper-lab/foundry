## Scope

*Define the boundaries of this legal risk assessment.*

- **Project / system:** [Name and brief description]
- **Jurisdictions:** [Applicable jurisdictions]
- **Risk categories covered:** [Contractual, regulatory, IP, data protection, operational]
- **Assessment period:** [Date range or project phase]
- **Out of scope:** [Anything explicitly excluded]

## Scoring Definitions

*Use these scales consistently across all risk entries.*

**Probability (1-5)**:
1 = Remote, 2 = Unlikely, 3 = Possible, 4 = Probable, 5 = Near certain

**Impact (1-5)**:
1 = Negligible, 2 = Minor, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Significant, 5 = Severe

**Risk Score**: Probability x Impact (1-25)
- 1-5 = Low, 6-12 = Medium, 13-19 = High, 20-25 = Critical
