## Change Overview

*Describe the change, its business drivers, and the target outcome.*

- **Change description**: [What is changing — system, process, tooling, or workflow]
- **Business driver**: [Why this change is happening — business outcome or problem being solved]
- **Current state**: [How things work today]
- **Future state**: [How things will work after the change]
- **Scope**: [Teams, departments, or user populations affected]
- **Timeline**: [Planned go-live date and key milestones]

## Stakeholder Impact Summary

*For each affected group, summarize the impact and the change they will experience.*

| Stakeholder Group | Current State | Future State | Impact Level | Key Concerns |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Group 1] | [How they work today] | [How they will work after] | High / Medium / Low | [Known or anticipated concerns] |
| [Group 2] | [Current state] | [Future state] | [Impact] | [Concerns] |
| [Group 3] | [Current state] | [Future state] | [Impact] | [Concerns] |

## Change Approach

*Define the overall approach: phased vs. big-bang, pilot strategy, and sequencing.*

- **Rollout approach**: [Phased / Pilot-then-expand / Big-bang]
- **Pilot group**: [Team or group for initial rollout, if applicable]
- **Phase sequence**: [Order in which groups or features are rolled out]
- **Rollback criteria**: [Conditions under which the change would be rolled back]

| [Factor 2] | [Likelihood] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] | [Name] |
| [Factor 3] | [Likelihood] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] | [Name] |

## Success Criteria

*Define how adoption success will be measured.*

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method | Timeframe |

| [e.g., Daily active usage of new tool] | [Current value] | [Target value] | [How it is measured] | [By when] |
