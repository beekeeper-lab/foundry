## Findings

### Finding 1: [Title]

[Description of the finding with supporting data. Include visualization if helpful.]

| Segment    | Metric     | Period 1 | Period 2 | Change |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|--------|
| [e.g., iOS] | [e.g., D7 retention] | [e.g., 42%] | [e.g., 35%] | [e.g., -7pp] |

**Interpretation:** [What does this mean in business terms?]

### Finding 2: [Title]

[Description with supporting data.]

---

## Limitations & Caveats

- [e.g., Analysis covers only organic users; paid acquisition cohorts were excluded due to data availability]
- [e.g., Correlation observed between X and Y does not imply causation]
- [e.g., Sample size for segment Z is small (n=150); interpret with caution]

---

## Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact | Confidence | Next Step |
|---|---------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | [e.g., Investigate onboarding flow changes in October release] | [e.g., High] | [e.g., Medium -- based on correlational evidence] | [e.g., A/B test revised onboarding] |
| 2 | [e.g., Segment retention reporting by acquisition channel] | [e.g., Medium] | [e.g., High -- clear data gap] | [e.g., Add channel dimension to retention dashboard] |

---

## Follow-Up Questions

- [e.g., Is the retention drop concentrated in specific geographies?]
- [e.g., Did the October release also affect engagement frequency?]
