## Scoring Definitions

*Use these scales consistently across all risk entries.*

**Likelihood (1-5)**:
1 = Rare, 2 = Unlikely, 3 = Possible, 4 = Likely, 5 = Almost certain

**Impact (1-5)**:
1 = Negligible, 2 = Minor, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Major, 5 = Severe

**Risk Score**: Likelihood x Impact (1-25)
- 1-5 = Low, 6-12 = Medium, 13-19 = High, 20-25 = Critical

## Risk Register Table

*Document each identified risk, its current controls, and the plan to manage it.*

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All known risks are captured with descriptions and categories
- [ ] Likelihood and impact scores use the defined scales
- [ ] Each risk has an assigned owner
- [ ] Current controls are documented for every risk
- [ ] Mitigation plans exist for risks not accepted
- [ ] Register reviewed and scores validated by a second party
- [ ] Review cadence is established and scheduled
