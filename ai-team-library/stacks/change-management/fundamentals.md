# Change Management Fundamentals

Principles and frameworks for managing organizational change effectively. Change
management ensures that transitions from current state to desired future state are
planned, communicated, and adopted with minimal disruption and maximum engagement.

## Defaults

| Aspect | Default | Alternatives |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Framework** | ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) | Kotter 8-Step, Lewin 3-Stage, Bridges Transition Model, McKinsey 7-S |
| **Scope** | People-side of change — adoption, engagement, resistance management | Technical change management (ITIL) focuses on system changes |
| **Governance** | Change Advisory Board (CAB) with defined escalation paths | Lightweight peer-review for low-risk changes |
| **Assessment** | Organizational readiness assessment before launch | Skip assessment only for trivial, low-impact changes |
| **Cadence** | Iterative — assess, plan, execute, reinforce in cycles | Big-bang rollouts for time-critical regulatory changes |

---

## ADKAR Framework

ADKAR is an individual change management model. Each person affected by a change
must progress through five sequential stages:

| Stage | Description | Key Activities |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | Understanding why the change is needed | Business case communication, sponsor messaging, town halls |
| **Desire** | Personal motivation to participate in the change | Address WIIFM (What's In It For Me), manage resistance, peer advocacy |
| **Knowledge** | Understanding how to change — skills and behaviors required | Training programs, documentation, job aids, mentoring |
| **Ability** | Demonstrated capability to implement the change | Hands-on practice, coaching, pilot programs, performance support |
| **Reinforcement** | Sustaining the change over time | Recognition, rewards, compliance monitoring, feedback loops |

### ADKAR Assessment Template

```
Change Initiative: ____________________
Assessment Date:   ____________________
Target Group:      ____________________

Score each dimension 1–5 (1 = not started, 5 = fully achieved):

Awareness:     [ ] 1  [ ] 2  [ ] 3  [ ] 4  [ ] 5
Desire:        [ ] 1  [ ] 2  [ ] 3  [ ] 4  [ ] 5
Knowledge:     [ ] 1  [ ] 2  [ ] 3  [ ] 4  [ ] 5
Ability:       [ ] 1  [ ] 2  [ ] 3  [ ] 4  [ ] 5
Reinforcement: [ ] 1  [ ] 2  [ ] 3  [ ] 4  [ ] 5

Barrier Point (lowest score): ____________________
Action Plan:   ____________________
```

The **barrier point** — the lowest-scored dimension — is where to focus
intervention. Attempting to push past a barrier point without addressing it
leads to failed adoption.

## Organizational Readiness Assessment

Assess readiness before launching any significant change initiative.

### Readiness Dimensions

| Dimension | Questions to Assess | Rating (1–5) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Leadership Alignment** | Do leaders agree on the need and direction? Are sponsors identified and active? | |
| **Culture** | Does the organization have a history of successful change? Is there change fatigue? | |
| **Capacity** | Do teams have bandwidth for this change alongside BAU work? | |
| **Capability** | Do affected groups have the skills needed, or is training required? | |
| **Communication Infrastructure** | Are channels in place to reach all affected groups? | |
| **Stakeholder Disposition** | What is the overall sentiment — supportive, neutral, or resistant? | |

### Readiness Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Readiness Level | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 25–30 | **High** | Proceed with standard change plan |
| 18–24 | **Moderate** | Address gaps before launch; increase sponsor engagement |
| 12–17 | **Low** | Significant pre-work needed; consider phased approach |
| 6–11 | **Not Ready** | Do not proceed; resolve fundamental blockers first |

## Change Types and Approaches

| Change Type | Scale | Approach | Timeline |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Incremental** | Small process tweaks, tool upgrades | Lightweight communication, embedded training | Days to weeks |
| **Transitional** | System replacements, team restructuring | Formal change plan, training programs, parallel running | Weeks to months |
| **Transformational** | Culture shifts, business model changes, mergers | Full change management program, executive sponsorship, sustained reinforcement | Months to years |

## Do / Don't

- **Do** start with a clear change vision that answers "why now" and "what's in it for me."
- **Do** identify and activate a sponsor coalition — executives who visibly champion the change.
- **Do** assess organizational readiness before committing to timelines.
- **Do** address resistance early and treat it as a signal, not an obstacle.
- **Do** measure adoption throughout the lifecycle, not just at go-live.
- **Do** plan reinforcement from day one — changes revert without sustained support.
- **Don't** announce a change without a plan for how people will be supported through it.
- **Don't** assume a good technical solution will sell itself. People adopt changes, not systems.
- **Don't** treat all resistance as irrational — listen for legitimate concerns that improve the plan.
- **Don't** skip the Desire phase. Awareness without motivation produces informed resisters.
- **Don't** rely solely on email for change communication. Use multiple channels and formats.
- **Don't** declare victory at go-live. Adoption is a process that continues well beyond launch.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Absent sponsorship.** The change has no visible executive champion, or the sponsor
   delegates all responsibility downward. Solution: define sponsor actions explicitly —
   communicate, participate, reinforce — and hold sponsors accountable.

2. **Change saturation.** Too many changes compete for the same group's attention and capacity.
   Solution: maintain a change portfolio view; stagger or consolidate initiatives.

3. **One-size-fits-all approach.** Every group receives the same communication and training
   regardless of impact level. Solution: segment audiences by impact and tailor activities.

4. **Skipping readiness assessment.** Rushing to implementation without understanding the
   starting point. Solution: always assess readiness; use findings to calibrate the plan.

5. **Measuring activity instead of adoption.** Tracking emails sent and training sessions
   delivered rather than behavior change and proficiency. Solution: define adoption KPIs
   that measure outcome (usage rates, error reduction, process compliance).

6. **Ignoring middle management.** Frontline managers are the most critical change agents,
   yet are often the last informed and least supported. Solution: equip managers with
   talking points, FAQs, and coaching skills before broader communication.
