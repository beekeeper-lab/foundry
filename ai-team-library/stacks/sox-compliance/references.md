## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ICFR** | Internal Control over Financial Reporting — the subset of internal controls relevant to SOX. |
| **Material Weakness** | A deficiency in ICFR such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. |
| **Significant Deficiency** | Less severe than a material weakness but important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of financial reporting. |
| **Key Control** | A control that, if it fails, could reasonably result in a material misstatement. |
| **ITGC** | IT General Controls — access management, change management, operations, and program development controls that underpin automated and IT-dependent manual controls. |
| **SoD** | Segregation of Duties — the principle that no single individual should control all aspects of a transaction. |
| **COSO** | Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission — publisher of the dominant internal controls framework. |
| **PCAOB** | Public Company Accounting Oversight Board — oversees auditors of public companies. |
| **COBIT** | Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies — ISACA's IT governance framework. |
| **Compensating Control** | An alternative control that mitigates the risk when a primary control cannot be implemented (e.g., SoD exception with management review). |
