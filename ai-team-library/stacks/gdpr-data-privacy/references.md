## Court Decisions

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Schrems II (C-311/18, 2020)** | CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield. Confirmed that SCCs remain valid but require case-by-case assessment of recipient country laws. Led to Transfer Impact Assessments becoming standard practice. |
| **Planet49 (C-673/17, 2019)** | CJEU confirmed that pre-ticked consent boxes are not valid consent under GDPR. Consent must be an active, affirmative act. |
| **Google Spain (C-131/12, 2014)** | Established the right to delisting (right to be forgotten) in the context of search engines. Pre-GDPR but influential in interpreting Article 17. |
| **Meta v Bundeskartellamt (C-252/21, 2023)** | CJEU ruled that competition authorities can assess GDPR compliance as part of competition law enforcement. Broadened the scope of GDPR enforcement actors. |
