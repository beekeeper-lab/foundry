# Competitive Battle Cards

Templates and practices for creating competitive battle cards that equip sales
engineers and account executives to win against specific competitors. A battle
card is not a feature comparison — it is a tactical playbook for a specific
competitive situation. It tells the SE what to say, what to demo, and what
landmines to avoid when facing a named competitor.

## Defaults

| Concern | Default | Alternatives |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Format** | One-page (front/back) structured card per competitor | Digital wiki page with expandable sections for deeper detail |
| **Update cadence** | Monthly review, immediate update on competitor launches or pricing changes | Quarterly refresh for stable markets; real-time feed for fast-moving markets |
| **Ownership** | Product Marketing creates; SE team reviews and contributes field intel | Competitive intelligence team for orgs with 5+ direct competitors |
| **Distribution** | Internal wiki with restricted access (sales + SE + product teams) | CRM-embedded cards that surface automatically based on deal competitor field |
| **Data sources** | Win/loss interviews, G2/Capterra reviews, competitor docs, field intel | Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), customer advisory board feedback |
| **Depth** | Tactical — focused on what to say in a call or demo | Strategic — includes market positioning, pricing analysis, roadmap comparison |
| **Competitor coverage** | Top 3 direct competitors + "status quo" (do nothing / spreadsheets) | Full landscape (5–10 competitors) for enterprise with diverse deal types |

## Battle Card Template

### [Competitor Name] Battle Card

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Owner:** [Name] | **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low

#### Quick Profile

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Company** | [Name, HQ, founded, funding/revenue if known] |
| **Target market** | [Their ideal customer profile] |
| **Pricing model** | [Per seat, usage-based, flat rate — with known price points] |
| **Key strengths** | [2–3 genuine strengths — be honest] |
| **Key weaknesses** | [2–3 weaknesses validated by customers or reviews] |
| **Recent moves** | [Latest product launch, acquisition, executive change, funding round] |

#### When You Encounter Them

| Scenario | What to do |
|----------|-----------|
| **They are the incumbent** | Lead with migration ease, ROI of switching, reference customers who switched |
| **They are in a bake-off** | Focus on your differentiators (see below); avoid feature-by-feature comparison |
| **Prospect mentions them casually** | Acknowledge without disparaging; pivot to your unique value |
| **They undercut on price** | Emphasize TCO (total cost of ownership), not license cost; quantify hidden costs |

#### Differentiators (Our Strengths)

| Differentiator | Talk Track | Proof Point |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| [Differentiator 1] | "[Specific language to use with prospect]" | [Customer quote, benchmark, or metric] |
| [Differentiator 2] | "[Specific language to use with prospect]" | [Customer quote, benchmark, or metric] |
| [Differentiator 3] | "[Specific language to use with prospect]" | [Customer quote, benchmark, or metric] |

#### Landmines (Their Strengths to Defuse)

| Their Claim | Reality | Our Response |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| "[Claim they make]" | [What is actually true] | "[How to reframe or address]" |
| "[Claim they make]" | [What is actually true] | "[How to reframe or address]" |

#### Trap Questions to Set

Questions to ask the prospect that expose the competitor's weaknesses:

- "Have you evaluated how [competitor] handles [known weakness scenario]?"
- "What is their approach to [area where we are stronger]?"
- "Can you share their SLA/uptime guarantees for [specific requirement]?"

#### Demo Strategy

| If competing against [Competitor] | Show | Avoid |
|----------------------------------|------|-------|
| Strength area 1 | [Specific feature/workflow] | [Feature where they are stronger] |
| Strength area 2 | [Specific feature/workflow] | [Area with known UX issues] |

## Win/Loss Intelligence

Battle cards improve when fed with real field data. Capture this after every
competitive deal:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Deal** | [Company, size, date] |
| **Competitor** | [Who we competed against] |
| **Outcome** | Win / Loss / No decision |
| **Why we won/lost** | [Primary reason from champion or evaluator] |
| **What resonated** | [Talk tracks, demos, or proof points that worked] |
| **What fell flat** | [Arguments or features that did not persuade] |
| **Prospect quotes** | [Direct quotes from the evaluation team] |

---

## Do / Don't

- **Do** be honest about competitor strengths. SEs who dismiss competitors lose
  credibility with technical evaluators who have done their research.
- **Do** focus on differentiation, not feature parity. Showing that you also
  have feature X is necessary but not sufficient — show why your approach is
  better for the prospect's situation.
- **Do** include specific talk tracks. "We are better at security" is useless.
  "We completed SOC 2 Type II in 6 months with zero findings; [competitor]
  published their first SOC 2 report last quarter" is actionable.
- **Do** update cards immediately when competitors make significant moves.
  Stale battle cards are worse than no battle cards.
- **Do** source intelligence from win/loss interviews, customer reviews, and
  field experience. Speculation is not strategy.
- **Do** train the sales team on how to use battle cards. A great card that
  nobody reads is wasted effort.
- **Don't** disparage competitors to prospects. It makes you look desperate and
  often backfires when the prospect has a relationship with the competitor.
- **Don't** create battle cards for every possible competitor. Focus on the 3–5
  you encounter most frequently. Spreading too thin makes every card shallow.
- **Don't** assume the competitor's product has not changed since you last
  evaluated it. Markets move fast.
- **Don't** include confidential or illegally obtained competitive intelligence.
  Ethical boundaries protect your company and your credibility.
- **Don't** use battle cards as a crutch for poor product-market fit. If you
  consistently lose to the same competitor on the same dimensions, the problem
  is product strategy, not sales tactics.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Stale cards.** Battle cards written 6 months ago reference competitor
   features that have since changed. Solution: assign ownership and set a
   monthly review cadence with a diff against the competitor's changelog.
2. **Internal bias.** Cards written by product marketing overstate your
   strengths and understate competitor strengths. Solution: involve SEs who
   have lost deals against the competitor; they bring objectivity.
3. **Too long.** A 10-page battle card is a research document, not a tactical
   tool. An SE in a live call needs answers in seconds. Solution: one page
   (front and back), with links to deeper detail for pre-call preparation.
4. **No proof points.** Differentiators listed without evidence. "Better
   performance" without benchmarks or customer quotes is an opinion, not a
   selling point. Solution: require at least one proof point per differentiator.
5. **Feature-only comparison.** Battle cards that compare features but ignore
   business outcomes, TCO, implementation effort, and support quality.
   Solution: include total cost of ownership and time-to-value comparisons.
6. **Unused cards.** Cards exist but the sales team does not know about them or
   cannot find them quickly. Solution: embed cards in the CRM so they surface
   when a competitor is tagged on a deal.
