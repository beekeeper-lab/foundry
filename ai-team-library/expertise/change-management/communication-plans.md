# Communication Plans

Frameworks and templates for planning, executing, and measuring change
communication. Effective communication builds awareness, reduces uncertainty,
and sustains engagement throughout the change lifecycle.

## Defaults

| Aspect | Default | Alternatives |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Principle** | Right message, right audience, right channel, right time | Blanket broadcast (not recommended) |
| **Frequency** | Cadenced communication aligned to change phases | Ad-hoc as needed (only for minor changes) |
| **Ownership** | Change lead drafts, sponsor delivers key messages | Communications team drafts, project team delivers |
| **Channels** | Multi-channel: meetings + written + digital + visual | Single channel only for low-impact changes |
| **Feedback** | Bi-directional — every communication includes a feedback path | One-way broadcast (not recommended) |

## Communication Planning Template

### Message Matrix

| Phase | Audience | Key Message | Channel | Sender | Timing | Feedback Mechanism |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Awareness** | All staff | Why this change is happening, what it means at a high level | Town hall + email | Executive sponsor | 4–6 weeks before go-live | Q&A session, anonymous survey |
| **Awareness** | Managers | Detailed impact, their role as change agents, FAQs | Manager briefing | Change lead + sponsor | 5–6 weeks before go-live | Open discussion, concerns log |
| **Desire** | Affected teams | What's in it for them, success stories, support available | Team meetings | Direct managers | 3–4 weeks before go-live | 1:1 conversations, pulse check |
| **Knowledge** | Affected teams | How to use new processes/tools, training schedule | Training sessions + job aids | Trainers | 2–3 weeks before go-live | Practice exercises, Q&A |
| **Ability** | Affected teams | Go-live details, support resources, who to contact | Email + intranet + posters | Change lead | 1 week before go-live | Help desk, floor walkers |
| **Reinforcement** | All staff | Progress updates, early wins, recognition | Newsletter + team meetings | Sponsor + managers | Post go-live (ongoing) | Adoption surveys, feedback forms |

## Channel Selection Guide

| Channel | Best For | Reach | Richness | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Town hall / all-hands** | Vision, strategic context, Q&A | High | High | Quarterly or at milestones |
| **Manager cascade** | Translating strategy to team impact | Medium | High | Per phase |
| **Team meetings** | Detailed impact, practice, support | Low | Very High | Weekly during transition |
| **Email / memo** | Formal announcements, reference material | High | Low | As needed |
| **Intranet / wiki** | Evergreen reference content, FAQs, job aids | High | Medium | Updated continuously |
| **Video / recording** | Sponsor messages, demos, training | High | Medium | Per phase |
| **Digital signage / posters** | Awareness, reminders, countdowns | High | Very Low | Pre-launch |
| **1:1 conversations** | Resistance management, coaching | Very Low | Very High | As needed |
| **Chat / messaging** | Quick updates, peer support, Q&A | Medium | Low | Daily during transition |

### Channel Mix Principle

Every key message should be delivered through at least two channels — a "push"
channel (reaches people directly) and a "pull" channel (available when they seek it).

```
Push (reaches audience):          Pull (audience seeks out):
├── Town hall                     ├── Intranet/wiki
├── Email                         ├── FAQ document
├── Manager cascade               ├── Recorded sessions
├── Team meetings                 ├── Help desk
└── Digital signage               └── Chat channel
```

## Messaging Framework

### Structuring Key Messages

Every change message should answer five questions:

1. **What** is changing?
2. **Why** is it changing? (business reason and urgency)
3. **Who** is affected and how?
4. **When** will it happen? (timeline and milestones)
5. **How** will people be supported? (training, resources, contacts)

### Message Tone Guide

| Phase | Tone | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Awareness** | Honest, clear, empathetic | "We're making this change because... We know this affects you, and here's how we'll support you." |
| **Desire** | Inspiring, benefit-focused, personal | "Here's what this means for your daily work and why it matters." |
| **Knowledge** | Practical, instructional, reassuring | "Here's exactly how to do X in the new system. Help is available at..." |
| **Ability** | Encouraging, supportive, patient | "It's normal to find this challenging at first. Here's where to get help." |
| **Reinforcement** | Celebratory, grateful, forward-looking | "Look at what we've achieved together. Here's how we keep building on this." |

## Sponsor Communication Blueprint

Executive sponsors must deliver specific messages that cannot be delegated:

| Message Type | Content | Frequency |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Vision & Why** | Strategic rationale, link to organizational goals | At launch, then quarterly |
| **Commitment** | Resource allocation, personal involvement, non-negotiables | At launch, then at milestones |
| **Progress & Wins** | Celebrate milestones, recognize contributors | Monthly |
| **Course Correction** | Honest updates when plans change, what's being done | As needed |
| **Reinforcement** | Sustained importance of the change, integration into BAU | Post go-live, quarterly |

## Do / Don't

- **Do** communicate early and often. Silence breeds anxiety and rumors.
- **Do** tailor messages to each audience's perspective and concerns.
- **Do** include a feedback mechanism with every communication.
- **Do** brief managers before broader announcements so they can field questions.
- **Do** repeat key messages through multiple channels — people need to hear things
  multiple times before they internalize them.
- **Do** acknowledge what you don't know yet. "We're still working on X and will update
  you by [date]" builds more trust than silence.
- **Don't** use jargon or corporate-speak. Plain language builds trust.
- **Don't** bury bad news. If the change has downsides, address them honestly.
- **Don't** communicate only through email. Email is necessary but not sufficient.
- **Don't** wait until everything is finalized to begin communicating. Share the
  journey, not just the destination.
- **Don't** forget to communicate "no change" — confirm what is staying the same
  to reduce unnecessary anxiety.
- **Don't** skip the manager cascade. Managers hearing news at the same time as
  their teams undermines their credibility and authority.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Communication vacuum.** Long gaps between updates allow rumors to fill the void.
   Solution: maintain a regular cadence even when there's "nothing new." Update on
   progress, next steps, or simply acknowledge the silence.

2. **Sender mismatch.** Strategic messages delivered by project managers instead of
   executives, or tactical details from the CEO. Solution: match sender authority to
   message type — sponsors for vision, managers for team impact, experts for how-to.

3. **Information overload.** Dumping all details at once instead of phasing information
   to match readiness. Solution: layer information — broad context first, details as
   people need them for action.

4. **One-way broadcast.** Communication without feedback channels. Solution: every
   announcement should include a way for recipients to ask questions, raise concerns,
   or provide input.

5. **Ignoring informal networks.** Official channels are complemented (or undermined)
   by water-cooler conversations and chat groups. Solution: identify informal influencers
   and equip them with accurate information. Monitor informal channels for emerging
   concerns.
