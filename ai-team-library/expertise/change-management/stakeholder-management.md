# Stakeholder Management

Techniques for identifying, analyzing, and engaging stakeholders affected by
organizational change. Effective stakeholder management ensures the right people
are informed, involved, and supported at the right time.

## Defaults

| Aspect | Default | Alternatives |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Mapping Tool** | Power/Interest Grid (Mendelow) | Stakeholder Salience Model, RACI Matrix, Influence/Impact Matrix |
| **Segmentation** | By impact level (high, medium, low) and disposition (advocate, neutral, resistant) | By organizational unit, geography, or role type |
| **Engagement Cadence** | Weekly for high-impact stakeholders, bi-weekly for medium, monthly for low | Continuous for transformational changes |
| **Tracking** | Stakeholder register with disposition tracking over time | Lightweight list for small changes |

---

## Power/Interest Grid

Map each stakeholder on two axes to determine engagement strategy:

```
                    HIGH POWER
                        │
         Manage Closely │  Keep Satisfied
         (Partner)      │  (Consult)
                        │
   HIGH ────────────────┼──────────────── LOW
   INTEREST             │              INTEREST
                        │
         Keep Informed  │  Monitor
         (Communicate)  │  (Minimal effort)
                        │
                    LOW POWER
```

| Quadrant | Strategy | Activities |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **High Power / High Interest** | Manage Closely | Co-design, regular 1:1s, decision involvement, early previews |
| **High Power / Low Interest** | Keep Satisfied | Executive summaries, milestone updates, escalation path |
| **Low Power / High Interest** | Keep Informed | Newsletters, town halls, feedback channels, FAQ access |
| **Low Power / Low Interest** | Monitor | General announcements, intranet updates |

### Disposition Scale

| Disposition | Description | Action |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Champion** | Actively promotes the change | Leverage as peer advocates and ambassadors |
| **Advocate** | Supportive, willing to participate | Reinforce, involve in co-design |
| **Neutral** | Neither for nor against | Provide information, address concerns, build desire |
| **Resistant** | Opposes the change | Listen to concerns, address root causes, involve in problem-solving |
| **Blocker** | Actively works against the change | Escalate to sponsor, one-on-one engagement, address fears |

---

## Impact Analysis

For each stakeholder group, assess what changes for them:

| Impact Dimension | Questions |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Process** | How do daily workflows change? What steps are added, removed, or modified? |
| **Technology** | What new tools or systems must be learned? What is retired? |
| **Skills** | What new competencies are required? What existing skills become less relevant? |
| **Reporting** | How do reporting lines, metrics, or accountability structures change? |
| **Culture** | How do expected behaviors, norms, or values shift? |
| **Job Security** | Are roles eliminated, created, or significantly redefined? |

### Impact Severity Matrix

| Severity | # of Dimensions Affected | Change Magnitude | Support Level Required |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Critical** | 4+ dimensions | Fundamental role change | Dedicated transition support, coaching |
| **High** | 2–3 dimensions | Significant workflow change | Structured training, regular check-ins |
| **Medium** | 1–2 dimensions | Moderate adjustments | Self-paced learning, available support |
| **Low** | 1 dimension | Minor tweaks | Communication only |

---

## Resistance Management

### Common Sources of Resistance

| Source | Indicator | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Fear of job loss** | Anxiety, rumors, disengagement | Transparent communication about role changes; retraining options |
| **Loss of control** | Pushback on decisions, micro-management of details | Involve in design, provide choices within boundaries |
| **Bad past experience** | Cynicism, "we tried this before" | Acknowledge past failures honestly, explain what's different |
| **Lack of trust** | Questioning motives, demanding proof | Build credibility through small wins, sponsor visibility |
| **Comfort with status quo** | Passive non-compliance, delays | Demonstrate clear pain of staying vs. benefit of changing |
| **Change overload** | Overwhelmed, prioritization conflicts | Reduce competing changes, protect capacity |

### Response Framework

1. **Listen** — understand the specific concern behind the resistance
2. **Acknowledge** — validate the concern without dismissing it
3. **Diagnose** — identify which ADKAR element is the barrier
4. **Address** — apply targeted intervention for that barrier
5. **Follow up** — check if the intervention moved the person forward

## Do / Don't

- **Do** map stakeholders early — before the first announcement, not after.
- **Do** reassess stakeholder positions regularly; dispositions shift as the change progresses.
- **Do** treat middle managers as the most critical stakeholder group. They translate
  strategy into daily reality.
- **Do** address resistance with curiosity, not force. Resistant stakeholders often have
  valid concerns that improve the change plan.
- **Do** maintain a stakeholder register as a living document throughout the initiative.
- **Don't** assume seniority equals influence. Informal influencers often matter more
  than org chart position.
- **Don't** over-communicate to low-impact groups while under-communicating to high-impact ones.
- **Don't** label resisters as "the problem." Resistance is information about gaps in
  the change approach.
- **Don't** skip impact analysis. Without it, engagement strategies are guesswork.
- **Don't** treat stakeholder management as a one-time exercise at project kickoff.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Invisible stakeholders.** Critical groups are missed because they sit outside the
   obvious project boundary (e.g., shared services, external partners, compliance teams).
   Solution: cast a wide net during identification; ask "who else is affected?"

2. **Static stakeholder map.** The initial assessment is never updated as the change
   evolves. Solution: review and update the stakeholder register at every phase gate.

3. **Treating all resistance equally.** Applying the same response to fundamentally
   different concerns. Solution: diagnose the ADKAR barrier point before designing
   the intervention.

4. **Sponsor delegation.** The executive sponsor delegates all stakeholder engagement
   to the project team. Solution: define non-delegable sponsor actions (visible
   communication, resource allocation, coalition building).

5. **Confusing engagement with broadcast.** Sending emails and considering stakeholders
   "managed." Solution: engagement means dialogue, not monologue. Create feedback
   mechanisms and act on input received.
