# Audit Procedures

Standards for planning, conducting, and following up on quality audits. Audits
verify that the QMS is implemented effectively and identify opportunities for
improvement. ISO 19011:2018 provides guidelines for auditing management systems.

---

## Defaults

- **Internal audits:** Conducted at planned intervals per ISO 9001:2015
  Clause 9.2. At minimum, annually for each process area.
- **External audits:** Certification body audits (Stage 1 documentation
  review, Stage 2 implementation audit) for ISO 9001 certification.
- **Audit standard:** ISO 19011:2018 — Guidelines for auditing management
  systems.
- **Auditor qualification:** Internal auditors must be trained, competent,
  and independent of the area being audited.

## Audit Types

| Type | Purpose | Conducted By | Frequency |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Internal (1st party)** | Verify QMS conformity and effectiveness | Organization's own trained auditors | At planned intervals (typically annual per process) |
| **Supplier (2nd party)** | Evaluate supplier QMS capability | Customer organization | As needed (supplier onboarding, periodic review) |
| **Certification (3rd party)** | Independent certification assessment | Accredited certification body | Initial: Stage 1 + Stage 2. Surveillance: annual. Recertification: every 3 years. |

## Internal Audit Process

### Step 1: Plan the Audit Program

- Define the annual audit schedule covering all QMS processes
- Assign audit teams — auditors must be independent of the area audited
- Identify audit criteria: ISO 9001 clauses, documented procedures, quality
  objectives
- Allocate resources and time

### Step 2: Prepare the Audit

- Review relevant documentation (procedures, previous audit reports,
  nonconformity records)
- Prepare an audit checklist based on applicable ISO 9001 clauses
- Communicate the audit plan to the auditee (scope, date, time, auditors)

### Step 3: Conduct the Audit

- **Opening meeting:** State the audit scope, objectives, and methods
- **Gather evidence:** Interview personnel, observe processes, review records
- **Record findings:** Classify as conformity, nonconformity (major/minor),
  or opportunity for improvement
- **Closing meeting:** Present findings to auditee management, agree on
  timelines for corrective actions

### Step 4: Report

```markdown
# Internal Audit Report

**Audit ID:** IA-2026-003
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** [Process area and ISO 9001 clauses audited]
**Auditor(s):** [Names]
**Auditee:** [Department/process owner]

## Summary
[Brief overall assessment]

## Findings

| # | Clause | Finding | Classification | Evidence |
|---|--------|---------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | 8.5.1 | Production records incomplete | Minor NC | Records for batch 2024-117 missing inspection sign-off |
| 2 | 7.2 | Training records current | Conformity | All staff training records verified |
| 3 | 10.2 | CAPA process could be faster | OFI | Average CAPA closure: 45 days |

## Corrective Actions Required
| # | Action | Owner | Due Date |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Update batch record template to require inspection sign-off | [Name] | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Auditor Signature: _______________
## Auditee Acknowledgment: _______________
```

### Step 5: Follow Up

- Track corrective actions to closure
- Verify effectiveness of corrective actions (may require a follow-up audit)
- Report results to management review

## Do / Don't

- **Do** plan audits based on risk — high-risk processes get more frequent audits.
- **Do** rotate auditors to maintain independence and fresh perspectives.
- **Do** use objective evidence (records, observations, data) for all findings.
- **Do** frame nonconformities constructively — the goal is improvement, not blame.
- **Do** track audit findings through to verified corrective action closure.
- **Don't** audit your own work — auditor independence is a core principle.
- **Don't** treat audits as a "gotcha" exercise. Adversarial audits damage trust
  and reduce the quality of information gathered.
- **Don't** skip follow-up on corrective actions. An unverified corrective action
  is an open nonconformity.
- **Don't** limit audits to documentation review. Observe actual practices and
  interview people doing the work.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Checklist-only auditing.** Auditor mechanically checks boxes without
   understanding the process. Solution: train auditors to probe, ask "why,"
   and follow the process end-to-end.
2. **Audit fatigue.** Too many audits with too little value. Solution: combine
   audit activities where possible, focus on risk areas, and reduce scope for
   well-performing processes.
3. **Findings without context.** "Nonconformity: procedure not followed" with no
   specifics. Solution: every finding must include the clause, the requirement,
   the evidence, and the gap.
4. **Corrective actions that address symptoms.** "Retrain the operator" instead
   of fixing the process that led to the error. Solution: require root cause
   analysis for all nonconformities.

## Auditor Competence

Per ISO 19011:2018, auditors should demonstrate:

| Competence | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Knowledge of audit principles** | Integrity, fair presentation, due professional care, confidentiality, independence, evidence-based approach |
| **Knowledge of the standard** | Understanding of ISO 9001 requirements and their intent |
| **Process knowledge** | Understanding of the processes being audited |
| **Communication skills** | Ability to interview, listen, and report clearly |
| **Analytical skills** | Ability to evaluate evidence and draw conclusions |
