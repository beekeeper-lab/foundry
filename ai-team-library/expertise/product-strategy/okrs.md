# OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

A goal-setting framework that connects ambitious qualitative objectives to
measurable key results. OKRs cascade from company strategy down to team and
individual levels, creating alignment without micromanagement.

## Defaults

| Concern | Default | Alternatives |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Cadence** | Quarterly OKRs with monthly check-ins | Annual OKRs for slow-moving orgs; 6-week cycles for fast-iteration teams |
| **Objectives per team** | 3–5 per quarter | Fewer for focused sprints; more only if team capacity is proven |
| **Key results per objective** | 2–4 measurable KRs | 1 KR for very narrow objectives; 5+ signals the objective is too broad |
| **Scoring method** | 0.0–1.0 scale (0.7 = on target) | Binary pass/fail for compliance-driven KRs; percentage-based for revenue targets |
| **Stretch vs. committed** | 70% stretch / 30% committed split | 100% committed for regulated industries; 100% stretch for R&D teams |
| **Cascading** | Top-down objectives, bottom-up key results | Fully top-down for early-stage alignment; bidirectional for mature teams |
| **Tracking tool** | Spreadsheet or lightweight tool (Notion, Confluence) | Dedicated OKR platforms (Gtmhub/Quantive, Weekdone) for 50+ person orgs |
| **Grading frequency** | End-of-quarter formal grade + mid-quarter informal check | Weekly KR updates for high-velocity teams |

## Do / Don't

- **Do** make objectives inspirational and qualitative. "Become the most trusted
  platform for SMB invoicing" not "Increase NPS by 10 points" — that is a key result.
- **Do** make every key result measurable with a number, percentage, or binary
  milestone. If you cannot measure it, it is not a key result.
- **Do** set stretch targets. Consistently hitting 100% of OKRs means targets are
  too easy. Aim for 60–70% achievement on stretch OKRs.
- **Do** cascade OKRs so every team can trace their objectives back to a company-level
  objective. Orphan OKRs signal misalignment.
- **Do** separate OKRs from performance reviews. Punishing missed stretch targets
  kills ambition and encourages sandbagging.
- **Do** review and grade OKRs at the end of each cycle. Ungraded OKRs teach nothing.
- **Don't** write more than 5 objectives per team per quarter. Focus beats breadth.
- **Don't** confuse key results with tasks. "Launch feature X" is a task. "Increase
  activation rate from 30% to 45%" is a key result. Tasks are the *how*; KRs are
  the *what*.
- **Don't** set OKRs in isolation. Cross-functional alignment meetings prevent
  conflicting objectives between teams.
- **Don't** change OKRs mid-quarter unless the business context has fundamentally
  shifted. Stability lets teams focus.
- **Don't** use OKRs for business-as-usual metrics. OKRs drive change; KPIs track
  steady-state health. Keep them separate.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Sandbagging.** Teams set easy targets to guarantee 100% completion. The OKR
   system rewards ambition, not certainty. Solution: calibrate scoring so 70%
   achievement on stretch goals is considered successful.
2. **Objective bloat.** Fifteen objectives per team means nothing is prioritized.
   Solution: force-rank and cut to 3–5. If everything is a priority, nothing is.
3. **Output-focused KRs.** "Ship 3 features" measures output, not outcome. The
   features might ship and move no needle. Solution: tie KRs to business or user
   outcomes (adoption, retention, revenue).
4. **Set-and-forget.** OKRs written in January and never revisited until March.
   Solution: monthly check-ins with traffic-light status (on track, at risk, off track).
5. **Misaligned cascading.** Company says "expand internationally" but no team has
   localization OKRs. Solution: draft company OKRs first, then hold a cascading
   workshop where teams propose aligned OKRs.
6. **Conflating OKRs with KPIs.** "Maintain 99.9% uptime" is a KPI, not an OKR.
   OKRs drive change from a current state to a desired future state. Solution:
   track KPIs on a health dashboard; reserve OKRs for step-change improvements.

## Cascading Example

```
Company Objective: Become the #1 platform for SMB financial management
  └─ KR1: Grow monthly active users from 50K to 120K
  └─ KR2: Achieve Net Promoter Score of 60+
  └─ KR3: Expand to 3 new markets

  Product Team Objective: Deliver a world-class onboarding experience
    └─ KR1: Increase 7-day activation rate from 30% to 55%
    └─ KR2: Reduce time-to-first-value from 12 min to under 4 min
    └─ KR3: Achieve onboarding completion rate of 80%+

  Engineering Team Objective: Build a reliable, fast platform that users trust
    └─ KR1: Reduce p95 API latency from 800ms to 200ms
    └─ KR2: Achieve 99.95% uptime (up from 99.8%)
    └─ KR3: Zero critical security incidents
```

## KR Scoring Template

| Key Result | Target | Actual | Score (0–1.0) | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Increase activation rate to 55% | 55% | 48% | 0.7 | On track |
| Reduce time-to-first-value to <4 min | 4 min | 5.2 min | 0.5 | At risk |
| Onboarding completion 80%+ | 80% | 82% | 1.0 | Achieved |

**Scoring guide:**
- **0.0–0.3:** Failed to make meaningful progress
- **0.4–0.6:** Made progress but fell short
- **0.7–0.8:** Hit the target (expected for stretch goals)
- **0.9–1.0:** Exceeded expectations (rare for stretch goals — recalibrate if frequent)
