## Conventions

*Follow these rules when updating the changelog.*

- Add entries under `[Unreleased]` as work is completed.
- Move `[Unreleased]` entries to a versioned section when a release is cut.
- Use past tense for descriptions (e.g., "Added support for..." not "Add support for...").
- Each entry should be a single bullet point with enough detail to understand the change.
- Link to issue or PR numbers where applicable (e.g., "Fixed login timeout (#42)").
- Versions use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- Categories with no entries for a given version may be omitted.
