## Purpose

*A single source of truth for project terminology. Reduces miscommunication across roles and teams.*

## How to Use This Glossary

*Add new terms as they emerge during design, development, or stakeholder conversations. Review quarterly or at each milestone to remove stale entries and resolve conflicts. The Owner column tracks who has authority over each term's definition.*

## Terms

## Conventions

- Define terms as they are used in this project, not general industry definitions (unless they match).
- If a term has a different meaning in another context, note the distinction.
- Avoid circular definitions (do not define term A using term B and term B using term A).
- When a term is deprecated, move it to the Deprecated Terms section rather than deleting it.

## Deprecated Terms

*Terms that were previously in use but have been replaced or retired.*

| Former Term       | Replaced By        | Date Deprecated | Reason                              |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| [old term]        | [new term or N/A]  | [YYYY-MM-DD]    | [why the term was changed]          |
