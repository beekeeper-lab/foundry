# Skill: Deploy

## Description

Promotes a source branch into a target branch via a pull request. Creates the PR, runs tests, and merges if they pass. One approval, no extra prompts.

Two modes:
- `/deploy` — Promotes `test` → `main` (default). Full release with branch cleanup.
- `/deploy test` — Promotes current branch → `test`. Integration deploy for feature branches.

## Trigger

- Invoked by the `/deploy` slash command.
- Source branch must be ahead of target branch.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| target | String | No | Target branch: `main` (default) or `test` |
| tag | String | No | Version tag for the merge commit (e.g., `v1.2.0`). Only valid when target is `main`. |

## Branch Resolution

| Target | Source | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `main` (default) | `test` | Release: promote integration branch to production |
| `test` | current branch | Integration: merge feature branch into test |

When target is `test`, the source is whatever branch you are on when you invoke `/deploy test`. This is typically a `bean/BEAN-NNN-<slug>` feature branch.

## Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Save current branch** — Record it so we can return at the end.
2. **Auto-stash if dirty** — If `git status --porcelain` shows changes, run `git stash --include-untracked -m "deploy-auto-stash"`. Do NOT ask — just stash and continue.
3. **Determine source and target:**
   - If target is `main`: source = `test`. Checkout `test`.
   - If target is `test`: source = the saved current branch. Stay on that branch.
4. **Push source** — `git push origin <source>` to ensure remote is up to date.
5. **Verify ahead of target** — `git log <target>..<source> --oneline`. If empty, report "Nothing to deploy", restore stash, return to original branch, exit.

### Phase 2: Quality Gate

6. **Run tests** — `uv run pytest` on the source branch.
   - If any fail: report failures, restore stash, return to original branch. Stop.
   - If all pass: record the count.

7. **Run ruff** — `uv run ruff check foundry_app/`. Record result.

### Phase 3: Build Release Notes

8. **Identify beans** — Parse `git log <target>..<source> --oneline` for `BEAN-NNN:` messages. Cross-reference with `ai/beans/_index.md` for titles.

9. **Count branches to clean** (target=`main` only) — List all `bean/*` branches (local + remote). Count how many are merged into main.

### Phase 4: User Approval — ONE prompt

10. **Present summary and ask once:**
    ```
    ===================================================
    DEPLOY: <source> → <target> (via PR)
    ===================================================

    Beans: <list>
    Tests: N passed, 0 failed
    Ruff: clean / N violations

    Post-merge: N feature branches will be deleted
    (branch cleanup shown only for target=main)

    On "go": create PR, merge it, delete branches,
    restore working tree. No further prompts.
    ===================================================
    ```

11. **Single approval:**
    - Target `main`: go / go with tag / abort
    - Target `test`: go / abort

    **CRITICAL: This is the ONLY user prompt. Everything after "go" runs without stopping.**

### Phase 5: Execute (no further prompts)

12. **Create PR:**
    ```bash
    gh pr create --base <target> --head <source> \
      --title "Deploy: <date> — <bean list summary>" \
      --body "<release notes>"
    ```

13. **Merge PR:**
    ```bash
    gh pr merge <pr-number> --merge --subject "Deploy: <date> — <bean list>"
    ```
    Use `--merge` (not squash/rebase) to preserve history.

14. **Tag (optional, target=`main` only)** — If requested: `git tag <version> && git push origin --tags`.

15. **Delete local feature branches (target=`main` only)** — All `bean/*` branches merged into main: `git branch -d`. Stale/orphaned ones for Done beans: `git branch -D`.

16. **Delete remote feature branches (target=`main` only)** — Any `remotes/origin/bean/*`: `git push origin --delete`.

17. **Sync local target** — `git checkout <target> && git pull origin <target>`.

18. **Return to original branch** — `git checkout <original-branch>`.

19. **Restore stash** — If we auto-stashed: `git stash pop`. On conflict, prefer HEAD.

20. **Report success** — PR URL, merge commit, beans deployed, branches deleted (if applicable).

## Key Rules

- **One approval gate.** User says "go" once. Everything after is automatic.
- **Auto-stash, auto-restore.** Dirty working tree handled silently.
- **PR is created AND merged.** Not just created — the full cycle completes.
- **Branch cleanup only on main deploys.** Feature branches are cleaned up when promoting to main, not when merging to test.
- **If a command is blocked by sandbox:** print the exact command for the user to run manually, then continue with the rest.

## Error Conditions

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Nothing to deploy | Report and exit |
| Tests fail | Report failures, restore stash, return. Fix first. |
| PR create fails | Report error. Check `gh auth status`. |
| PR merge fails | Report error. Check branch protection / conflicts. |
| User aborts | Restore stash, return to original branch |
| Command blocked | Print command for manual execution, continue |
