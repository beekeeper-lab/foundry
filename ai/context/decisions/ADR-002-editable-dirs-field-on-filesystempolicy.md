# ADR-002: Editable Dirs Field on FileSystemPolicy

## Context

The safety service hardcodes `Edit(src/**)`, `Edit(tests/**)`, and `Edit(ai/**)` in `safety_to_settings_json()`. Projects with non-standard source directories (e.g. `foundry_app/`, `lib/`, `app/`) must manually fix `settings.local.json` after generation.

## Decision

Add an `editable_dirs: list[str]` field to `FileSystemPolicy` with a default of `["src/**", "tests/**", "ai/**"]`. The safety service iterates this list to generate `Edit()` rules.

**Field name:** `editable_dirs` (not `source_dirs`) because the list includes non-source directories like `tests/**` and `ai/**`.

**Default value:** `["src/**", "tests/**", "ai/**"]` — matches current hardcoded behavior exactly, ensuring zero-effort backward compatibility.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Projects with non-standard layouts work out of the box.
- Backward compatible: existing compositions and presets get the same defaults.
- Simple, single-field change with no cascading model restructuring.

**Negative:**
- Users must know their directory layout at composition time (no auto-detection).
- The field name `editable_dirs` could be confused with filesystem deny_patterns. Mitigated by tooltip text in the wizard.

## Alternatives Rejected

1. **`source_dirs` field name:** Rejected because the field covers `tests/**` and `ai/**`, not just source code.
2. **Separate fields for source, test, and AI directories:** Over-engineered. A single list is simpler and more flexible.
3. **Auto-detect from project structure:** Out of scope — generation often happens before the project directory exists.
