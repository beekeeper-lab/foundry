## Goal

Define molecularity criteria and add a molecularity gate to the backlog-refinement skill and bean workflow documentation. Provide guidance on decomposing oversized beans.

## Inputs

- `ai/context/bean-workflow.md` — current bean lifecycle
- `.claude/skills/backlog-refinement/SKILL.md` — refinement skill definition
- `ai/beans/BEAN-147-molecularity-gate/bean.md` — bean definition and acceptance criteria

## Definition of Done

- [x] Molecularity criteria are defined (what makes a bean appropriately sized)
- [x] A gate/check step is added to the backlog-refinement skill's Phase 2 (Dialogue)
- [x] Guidance for decomposing oversized beans is documented
- [x] Changes are minimal and do not break existing workflow steps
