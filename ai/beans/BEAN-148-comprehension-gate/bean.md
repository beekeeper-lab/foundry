## Problem Statement

AI team members sometimes begin work on a bean without fully understanding the existing codebase, architecture, or constraints. This leads to implementations that conflict with established patterns, introduce redundancy, or miss important context.

## Goal

Add a comprehension gate to the bean workflow that requires demonstrating understanding of the relevant codebase area before implementation begins. This ensures each team member reads and understands the existing code before making changes.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Define comprehension gate criteria (what must be understood before work begins)
- Add a pre-implementation verification step to the bean workflow
- Specify how comprehension is demonstrated (e.g., summary of existing patterns)

### Out of Scope
- Changes to the application code
- Automated code comprehension tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehension gate criteria are defined and documented
- [ ] Pre-implementation verification step is added to workflow
- [ ] Method for demonstrating comprehension is specified
- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable
