## Problem Statement

The Foundry library lacks an ISO 9000 certification and compliance officer tech stack option. Users who need quality management system compliance cannot generate projects with ISO 9000 guidance.

## Goal

Add a new tech stack option in the ai-team-library for ISO 9000 Certification and Compliance Officer. Include detailed skill descriptions and third-party references that agents can read.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Create ISO 9000 tech stack YAML in the library
- Include certification-specific skills and knowledge areas
- Add references to ISO standards, ANSI resources, and compliance guides
- Ensure the stack integrates with the existing library indexer

### Out of Scope
- Modifying the library indexer service itself
- Creating a new persona (uses existing personas)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ISO 9000 tech stack YAML exists in the library
- [ ] Stack includes relevant skills (QMS, audit, document control, CAPA, etc.)
- [ ] References to third-party sources are included
- [ ] Library indexer can discover and index the new stack
- [ ] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] Lint clean (`uv run ruff check foundry_app/`)
