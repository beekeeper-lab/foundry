## Problem Statement

The current tech stack library has not been comprehensively reviewed for gaps. There may be valuable technical, auditing, legal, and professional skill domains missing that would make Foundry more versatile.

## Goal

Review all existing tech stack options in the library. Identify new tech stack options that should be added — including technical developer skills, languages, auditing capabilities, legal/compliance personas, and professional services. Create Trello backlog cards for each recommended addition.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Audit existing tech stacks in the library
- Identify gaps across categories: developer tools, languages, compliance/audit, legal, professional services
- Consider new persona types (e.g., lawyer persona for contract negotiation)
- Create Trello cards on the Backlog list for each recommended new stack
- Provide rationale for each recommendation

### Out of Scope
- Implementing the new tech stacks (separate beans)
- Modifying existing tech stacks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing tech stacks reviewed and catalogued
- [ ] Gap analysis completed with at least 5 new stack recommendations
- [ ] Each recommendation includes: name, category, brief description, rationale
- [ ] Trello cards created on the Backlog list for each recommendation
- [ ] Review report saved to `ai/outputs/architect/`
