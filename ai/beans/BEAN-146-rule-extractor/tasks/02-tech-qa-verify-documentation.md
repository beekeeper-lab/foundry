## Goal

Verify that the rule extraction documentation added by the Developer is clear, complete, and actionable. Confirm no existing workflow steps are broken.

## Inputs

- [x] Storage location for extracted rules is defined
- [x] Post-bean review step is integrated into the existing workflow without gaps
